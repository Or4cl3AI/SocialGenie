      <h1>Scalable Architecture</h1>
      <p>
        Scalability is a crucial aspect of SocialGenie's architecture. With the increasing number of users and the need to handle high traffic, our application is designed to scale horizontally and vertically.
      </p>
      <p>
        To achieve horizontal scalability, we utilize AWS Elastic Beanstalk and AWS ECS for deploying and managing multiple instances of our application. These services automatically handle load balancing and scaling based on demand, ensuring optimal performance and availability.
      </p>
      <p>
        For vertical scalability, we leverage containerization with Docker and Kubernetes. By containerizing our application components, we can easily scale individual services based on resource requirements. Kubernetes provides orchestration and management of containers, allowing us to efficiently utilize resources and handle traffic spikes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, we employ AWS Lambda and the Serverless Framework for serverless computing. This enables us to offload certain tasks to serverless functions, reducing the load on our main application servers and improving scalability.
      </p>
      <p>
        To monitor the performance and scalability of our application, we utilize AWS CloudWatch, New Relic, and Datadog. These tools provide real-time monitoring, alerting, and performance analysis, allowing us to proactively identify and address any scalability issues.
      </p>
      <p>
        With our scalable architecture, SocialGenie can handle the growing demands of our users and ensure a seamless experience even during peak usage periods.
